/**
 * We should support/experiment with modelling css dependencies using the exact
 * same commonJS resolution, so that we can include CSS files in our React npm
 * modules. An npm module should include everything needed to work with your
 * component - and it is impossible to know where your component will be
 * installed to.
 *
 *    // Depends on css from my project - relative paths automatically resolved.
 *    require('./SiteBoilerPlate.css');
 *
 *    // Depends on css from dependency 'bootstrap' in package.json
 *    require('bootstrap/Text-Input.css');
 *
 * For now, you have to (one by one) make sure the index.js page includes the
 * css file your project depends on directly. Even in that case, we'll use
 * commonJS resolution for css files as well, so that if you whitelist things in
 * node_modules for inclusion in your bundle, the resources in those will be
 * accessible as well.

 * Usage:
 *
 * var React = require('React');
 * var SiteBoilerPlate = require('./components/SiteBoilerPlate.jsx');
 * var MyPage = React.createClass({
 *   render: function() {
